# Common Issues

A reference list of common problems encountered when working with AI tools, coding projects, and prompt engineering — plus practical fixes.

---

## 1. Vague or Poor Results from AI

**Problem:**
AI gives generic, unclear, or incorrect answers.

**Cause:**

* Prompt is too broad
* Missing context or constraints

**Solution:**

* Be specific about the goal
* Add context, examples, and constraints

**Example Fix:**

> Instead of: *"Build a website"*
> Use: *"Build a responsive 3-page HTML/CSS website for a small business in Kenya, including a contact form."*

## 2. Incorrect or Non-Working Code

**Problem:**
AI-generated code produces errors or does not run.

**Cause:**

* Version mismatch (framework, language)
* Missing dependencies
* Partial code output

**Solution:**

* Specify language and version
* Ask for full, runnable code
* Test incrementally

---

## 3. Missing Project Files or Structure

**Problem:**
Project fails because required files are missing.

**Cause:**

* AI only generated one file
* Project structure not requested

**Solution:**

* Ask for full folder structure
* Request file-by-file explanations

---

## 4. Overly Long or Unfocused Responses

**Problem:**
AI responses are too long or go off-topic.

**Cause:**

* No word or format limit specified

**Solution:**

* Set limits (e.g. word count, bullet points)

**Example:**

> *"Explain in 150 words using bullet points."*

## 5. Hallucinated or False Information

**Problem:**
AI provides information that sounds correct but is false.

**Cause:**

* AI predicting text instead of verifying facts

**Solution:**

* Cross-check important information
* Ask for sources or confirmations

---

## 6. Prompt Works Once but Not Again

**Problem:**
A prompt gives good results once but fails later.

**Cause:**

* Prompt not reusable or clear enough

**Solution:**

* Rewrite prompt using a template
* Save improved versions in a prompt journal

---

## 7. AI Misunderstands the Task

**Problem:**
AI answers a different question than intended.

**Cause:**

* Ambiguous wording
* Multiple tasks in one prompt

**Solution:**

* Break tasks into steps
* Number instructions clearly

---

## 8. Over-Reliance on AI

**Problem:**
User depends on AI without understanding the output.

**Risk:**

* Poor learning
* Plagiarism issues

**Solution:**

* Always review and edit AI output
* Add personal understanding and reflection

---

## Best Practices

* Always test AI-generated code
* Iterate prompts instead of rewriting from scratch
* Document what works and what fails
* Treat AI as an assistant, not a replacement
